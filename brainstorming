Requirements:
- Attack Scenerio (malicious or semi-honest)
- Proposed Data Analysis Application
- Building Blocks (methods for anonymization/ cryptographic schemes)
- Dataset 


Ideas:
- Machine learning through text 
    - determining/detecting humor

    - detecting email spam/malware

    other mediums:
    - reviews (product recommendations)
    - news articles
    - tweets
    - chatbot


- Machine learning though image data (this seems hard)
    - facial/action recognitoin
    - object detection
    - handwriting detection
    - aerial images
    - self driving cars
    - style/ fashion analytics


- Machine learning through signals (less interesting to me but if you guys are into this it could work, im an ECE major in a signals class right now)
    - electric
    - traffic (this might be images still)
